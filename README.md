I wear headphones while in my studio/workspace. With the 3D printer going, music blaring, and any number of drills active, I can't hear a thing. 

The door into the shed is situated behind my desk. Anyone entering is usually a surprise and one that terrifies me, always catches me off-gaurd.

At first I thought I'd use a rear-view mirror mounted near my desktop monitor. If someone were to enter I'd see them from behind. 

But the mirror was too small and I often wasn't paying attention to the mirror, even if something was happening inside it. I thought maybe I'll get an old-fashioned shop chime and hang it over the door. That seemed silly, because I still wouldn't hear it over the music and machines.

So I came up with this out of boards and parts I had lying around. Doorbell activates light flicker: presto! Alerted to someone at the door. Only the doorbell had to be ordered. </a>
